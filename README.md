# Stress-Detection

I built a full-stack system to detect stress in employees using different types of data â€” such as heart rate, sleep patterns, work performance, and text-based communication.

The system uses a machine learning model inspired by Gradient Boosting to combine all this data and predict stress levels accurately. I improved the model by selecting the right features, tuning its settings, and testing it to make sure it works well.

I also created a responsive dashboard where managers can see real-time stress trends, set alert thresholds, and get practical suggestions for reducing stress before it becomes a serious problem.

The backend processes live sensor data and past records quickly, while the front-end is easy to use and secure, with role-based access to protect sensitive health details.

This project brings together data science, machine learning, and full-stack development to create a tool that helps improve employee well-being and productivity.
